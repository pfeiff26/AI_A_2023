    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Step into the captivating realm of automated music composition, as I will walk you through the code of a machine learning model that aims to compose music in the style of Bach chorales. Johann Sebastian Bach was one of the most influential composers of all times, inspiring generations of artists to come with his masterful use of harmonisation techniques such as counterpoint. Bach chorales, specifically, are harmonisations of hymn melodies which contain four parts, meaning that four notes are written to be played at the same time. Today, with the help of machine learning, you too can become a musical genius like Bach. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imitating the styles of renowned artists has been a key interest of computational creativity research (a branch of artificial intelligence). The purpose of these studies is to assess whether machine-generated art has reached human-like quality. Within the context of music, Bach chorales generation is one of the most widely used case studies, because J.S. Bach wrote over 400 chorale pieces that all follow the same compositional rules - characteristics that are ideal for machine learning models. The bigger and more homogenous the collection of examples, the easier it is for a machine learning model to understand the complex underlying patterns. Imagine someone showed you different songs by the same artist and asked you what aspects of the music you would describe as their unique \"signature sound\". It would be much harder to give a useful response if you only heard two songs instead of 400. Similarly, it would be very difficult to summarise what the music has in common, if the artist ventured out into lot of different styles instead of sticking to the same format. \n",

    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this exercise contains the sheet music of 382 J.S. Bach chorales. For the music to be machine-readable, it has to be converted into numbers. This is achieved by representing each note as its index on the piano, with number 0 indicating the absence of a note. The chorales stored in the dataset are broken down into 1/16th time units, each unit containing four numbers which indicate the four notes being played on this count.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Dataset Source](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2/blob/master/15_processing_sequences_using_rnns_and_cnns.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is being fed into a \"neural network\" - an advanced machine learning model which aims to simulate the structure of the human brain. It consists of different layers of neurons (the equivalent of a brain cell) which communicate with other neurons in the layer behind them in an effort to learn patterns from the data they receive. Each neuron (also called node) in the network is like a sensor that picks up one specific pattern and sends its insights to the next, processing increasingly complex information which each subsequent layer. In this case, the neural network should learn to recognise the relationships between notes in the chorales and through that analyse the compositional style of J.S. Bach. The goal is for the neural network to be able to predict the notes which J.S. Bach would have chosen to continue a given melody. If successful, it can be used to produce novel compositions that sound very musical and are indistinguishable from real Bach chorales. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although what is considered musical and what is not is a highly subjective experience, there is some sort of common understanding for what melodies are aesthetically pleasing. The Oxford dictionary defines musical as \"having a pleasant sound; melodious or tuneful.\" Have you ever heard a child improvise on their instrument for the first time? While they might be generating notes on it, it can be quite a painful to sit through. Now compare that to a solo by a professional Jazz musician. Or listen to the [new Dua Lipa Single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suAR1PYFNYA) side-by-side with [Stockhausen's Gesang der JÃ¼nglinge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nffOJXcJCDg). Which one do you perceive as more melodious and pleasant-sounding? \n"

Essentially, one can envision these vectors as coordinates for a map of all musical notes and each melody a route for a journey throughout this map. By having five numbers to capture attributes in, the computer can develop a more nuanced understanding of the relationships between notes compared to having a single number represent it.

Imagine you are reading the sheet music for the chorales, and with each filter, you focus on different aspects of the notes.

    "- At first, the predictions of the model are going to be very random and non-musical. To be able to accurately predict the next note in a sequence, the model needs to learn which of the patterns it picks up on are the most important indicators for which note comes next. This is determined through internal parameters called weights and biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In each iteration of the training process, the model receives feedback on how well it did. If its prediction was close to the actual next note in a Bach chorale, it gets positive feedback. If it's wrong, it learns from the mistake. A so-called loss function is the model's measure of how wrong its prediction was, i.e. how much the predicted note diverged from the real one.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Now, just like a musician adjusting their performance based on feedback, the model tweaks its parameters, to minimise the loss function. An Algorithm called optimiser adjusts the model's weights and biases in ways that make the loss value a little smaller with each iteration. Through this process, the model becomes incrementally better at suggesting the right most Bach-like notes in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- During the validation process, the model performs on a set of Bach chorales it has not seen during training. This is like checking how well the model can now compose new chorales in Bach's style, not just repeat what it has memorised.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The training and validation process is repeated 20 times. It goes through the entire dataset with each iteration referred to as \"epochs\".\n",

    "### Evaluating the results\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unlike other forms of generative AI, music generation systems are usually evaluated by humans listening to the machine compositions ([Carnovalini and RodÃ  (2020)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7861321/) ). Therefore, I decided to judge the performance of the model by listening to the generated examples. The chorale generated with the \"cold\" temperature setting sounds the most musical but, as pointed out before, it often holds notes significantly longer than what the listener would expect. Consequently, while the harmonisations sound Bach-like and aesthetically pleasing, the rhythmic composition of the chorale sounds uninteresting and artificial. While increasing the temperature brings more diversity into the compositions, it makes them sound less aesthetically pleasing and stylistically accurate. Overall, while the statistical evaluation resulted in an accuracy of over 80%, the results still lack a deeper sense of musicality that can be hard to capture with numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Own Application\n",
    "\n",
    "- I would like to use the machine learning techniques featured in the code to apply them to a different musical context, such as pop music. The required dataset would need to be similarly structured to the existing one. To achieve a similiar four-voice format, it could contain one main vocal melody, one backing vocal harmony, one high-pitched and one low pitched instrumental part.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- I am interested in exploring if it would perform better with pop music since it is often considered to contain simpler melodies and harmonies. At the same time, the compositional rules are largely less strict and it will be hard to find a comparably homogenous training corpus. I am also just curious to see what kind of songs the model would come up with and if they sound musical at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To feed the pop songs into the computer they would first need to be manually transcribed to sheet music and then converted into numerical form. Most modern productions include more than four voices so one would have to decide which instrumental parts to use. The preprocessing workflow would be very similiar to the one outlined in this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This model and similiar AIs generate music based on existing composition. While J.S. Bach's music is in the public domain, datasets containing more recent compostions that are protected by copyright, there is a concern about the originality and ownership of the generated music. If any AI-generated compositions are published, there is a risk of unintentional plagiarism. Also composers are usually not compensated when their music is used as training data.\n",
