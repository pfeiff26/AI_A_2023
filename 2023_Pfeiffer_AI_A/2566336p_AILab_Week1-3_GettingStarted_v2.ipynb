    "While the audio player interface does load, both audio files cannot be played back. It makes sense that a midi file cannot be played since it does not contain any audio, but only information on pitch, rhythm and velocity. A midi file would need to be translated into audio with a sound generator found in a separate python library, such as \"music21\". However, the audio player should be able to correctly play the Ogg Vorbis file. Originally my audiofile did not download as \"audio2\" (as specified in the instructions) but as Goldbergvarations (...). However, even after changing the file name do the suggested title, the audio file did not play.A quick Google search suggests that this might be due to an error with the server hosting the jupyter notebook which leads to a misinterpretation of the .ogg MIMEtype. Other Formats such as WAV or MP3 are said to be more compatible."
